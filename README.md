You'll be able to find here my personal projects, mostly in ***Python*** since it is the language I find the easiest at the moment.

Here are the most notable ones:

### [__LittleBot__](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/LittleBot)
This repo contains my first ever project, that I started while having __mostly__ no clue about Python. It is still functional and the bot is working quite fine.

With this project, I learned:
- Using the discord.py library
- Asynchronous programing (the basics)
- The idea behind decorators

### __[Projet-Graphes](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/Projet-Graphes)__
This was a school project that Iâ€™m pretty proud of, since it is my first *real* C++ program.

The main things that I learned are:
- The proper usage of header files
- Shortest Path algorithms
- Functional programming in C++

### __[MX-MapFetcher](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/MX-MapFetcher)__
My most recent "big" project, where I learned the basics of tkinter (It seemed to be the easiest GUI library in Python, not the most beautiful).
This project is fully functional and works well, but if I had to redo it, I would use an OOP approach instead of functional programing, which is not the most elegant way to use this library

### __[YT-Playlist](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/YT-Playlist)__
An utility that I had in mind for a while, to keep a trace of my musical playlists on youtube. In its current form, it is hardly usable for anyone else but I'll work on making it more accessible and expand the options (notably give the possibility to download playlists)
