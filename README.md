You'll be able to find here my personal projects, mostly in Python since it is the language I find the easiest at the moment.

Here are the most notable ones:

### [LittleBot](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/LittleBot)
This repo contains my first ever project, that I started while having mostly no clue about Python. It is still functional and the bot is working quite fine.

With this project, I learned:
- Using the discord.py library
- Asynchronous programing (the basics)
- The idea behind decorators

### [Projet-Graphes](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/Projet-Graphes)
This was a school project that Iâ€™m pretty proud of, since it is my first *real* C++ program.

The main things that I learned are:
- The proper usage of header files
- Shortest Path algorithms
- Functional programming in C++

### [MX-MapFetcher](https://github.com/LukaP-BB/MX-MapFetcher)
My most recent "big" project, where I learned the basics of tkinter (It seemed to be the easiest GUI library in Python, not the most beautiful).
This project is fully functional and works well, but if I had to redo it, I would use an OOP approach instead of functional programing, which is not the most elegant way to use this library
